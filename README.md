# Project
This is Machine Learning Project I have done with 2 other teammantes.
We have analyzed the raw data from Kaggle about the sales of almost every game using the python. We first splitted test data and training data then analyzed the data with Linear, Ridge, and Lasso Regression model. When I analyzed the data, I used Python's Pandas, Numpy, Scikit-Learn, and Matplotlib library. The result came out as Ridge Regression to be the optimal model for this data since it had the lowest RMSE and highest R-Square values.
